# Website-Ad-Click-Research-Project
The goal of the case study is to Predict who is likely going to click on the advertisement using Logistic regression so it can contribute to the more revenue generation to the organization. The main variable we are interested in is 'Clicked on Ad'. This variable can have two possible outcomes: 0 and 1 where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement, while 1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the advertisement.
